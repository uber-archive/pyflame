# This is kind of hacky, so it deserves an explanation.
#
# We want to test all supported Python builds against both 32-bit and 64-bit
# builds. The Travis build matrix for old Python versions is completely busted,
# there are missing files, and they do gross stuff to the environment, like
# trying to install everything into virtualenvs. Therefore, we need to install
# the Python releases maintained in ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes.
#
# The i386 Python 2.x releases from ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes put their .pc files
# in the wrong place. For some reason forcing PKG_CONFIG_PATH doesn't help, so
# we manually export the flags. Pull requests welcome, if anyone figure out a
# less bad way to do this.
#
# The tests don't work for the i386 builds at all, because Travis only lets you
# run things on amd64 hosts. There are a couple of other projects using Travis
# that are using qemu to run i386 tests, but that sounds really slow and
# complicated. Again, pull requests welcome if anyone figures out how to test
# the i386 builds.
